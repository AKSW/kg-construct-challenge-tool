********************************************************************************
WARNING: POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD has been set to "trust". This will allow
         anyone with access to the Postgres port to access your database without
         a password, even if POSTGRES_PASSWORD is set. See PostgreSQL
         documentation about "trust":
         https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-trust.html
         In Docker's default configuration, this is effectively any other
         container on the same system.
         It is not recommended to use POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust. Replace
         it with "-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password" instead to set a password in
         "docker run".
********************************************************************************
The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "postgres".
This user must also own the server process.
The database cluster will be initialized with locale "en_US.utf8".
The default database encoding has accordingly been set to "UTF8".
The default text search configuration will be set to "english".
Data page checksums are disabled.

Success. You can now start the database server using:
initdb: warning: enabling "trust" authentication for local connections
You can change this by editing pg_hba.conf or using the option -A, or
--auth-local and --auth-host, the next time you run initdb.
